Date:Jan 18,2020.

For Example:
Base Values
Numeral	Value	Numeral	Value
I	1	V	5
X	10	L	50
C	100	D	500
M	1000		
Combining rule
Numeral values are added together, unless the numeral is followed by a greater numeral.  In this case, the smaller numeral value is subtracted from the following value.
Examples
Roman	Arabic	Roman	Arabic
III	3	VI	6
IV	4	XCII	92
Fractions
The romans represented fractions using two symbols, ‘S’ for semis – a half, and ‘∙’ for an uncia – a twelfth.
Examples
Roman	Arabic	Roman	Arabic
IIIS	3 1/2	VI∙∙	6 2/12=6 1/6
IVS∙∙∙	4 9/12=4.75	XCIIS∙∙∙∙	92 10/12
We’ll have to use periods for the dots, since a dot is not easily typed on a standard keyboard.
Vinculum
The apostrophus system is very limited in the possible number that can represented.  The vinculum system writes a bar above the numerals indicate that the numerals beneath should be multiplied by 1,000.  Thus, ¯("IV" ) is 4,000. 
Examples
Roman	Arabic	Roman	Arabic
¯("IV" )	4,000	¯("IV" ) "XX" 	4,020

Apostrophus (Balanced)
The earlier method for representing large numbers is the apostrophus.  In this system, the number five hundred ‘D’ is represented by an ‘I’ and a backward c – ‘Ↄ’ (D = IↃ).  One thousand (1000) was written as CIↃ.  Adding C’s to either side multiplies the number by 10.
Examples
Roman	Arabic	Roman	Arabic
CIↃ	1,000	CCCIↃↃↃ	100,000
CCIↃↃ	10,000	CCCCIↃↃↃↃ	1,000,000
CCIↃↃLII	10,052	CCCCIↃↃↃↃI	1,000,001

If there are additional backwards c’s, we add a multi of five.
Examples (Unbalanced)
Roman	Arabic	Roman	Arabic
IↃ	500	IↃↃↃ	50,000
IↃↃ	5,000	IↃↃↃↃ	500,000
IↃↃDLV	5,555	IↃↃↃↃV	500,005

These can be combined…
Examples (Unbalanced)
Roman	Arabic	Roman	Arabic
CIↃↃ	1,500	CCIↃↃↃↃ	15,000
CCIↃↃↃ	10,500	CCCIↃↃↃↃↃↃ	150,000
CCIↃↃↃXXI	10,521	CCCIↃↃↃↃↃↃIV	150,004
